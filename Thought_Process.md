I will outline my thought process for each step of the project.

I will use Rails for this project, as it is the framework Lost_my_Name use, and
I am comfortable with it, I will use Rspec, and postgresgl, as I am familiar
with both.

I decided to use a rake task to add email data instead of using Go, for this
small project it didn't seem necessary, and I knew I could achieve the same
result quickly and possibly make it easier to use for people without previous Go
knowledge.
